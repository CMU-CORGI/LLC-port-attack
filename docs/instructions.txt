This document provides instructions on running the code in this repository.
Most of the code is self-explanatory and heavily documented, so here we describe
only the requirements to run the code.

The code for running the port attack is all contained within code/.

The code utilizes huge pages in order to ensure that virtual addresses determine
the cache set in the LLC. Instructions for setting up huge pages can be found in
docs/hugepages.txt.

The code relies upon architectural parameters to work correctly. You must set
the correct values for your processor in code/constants.h.

If using a multi-socket system, ensure that all threads run on a single socket
by using OS code affinity functionality (see code/portAttack.cpp and code/Makefile).

To run the main attack code:
$ cd code/
$ make runPortAttack

Example graph scripts can be found in graphs/. As is, they graph the results
reported in the Jumanji paper.
