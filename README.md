LLC Port Attack Code
====================

This repository provides code to demonstrate a processor security vulnerability
through shared LLC ports. The attack was developed by the [Computer Organization
Research Group (CORGi)](https://cmu-corgi.github.io/) at Carnegie Mellon
University.

The demonstration of this LLC port attack is shown in **Jumanji: The Case for
Dynamic NUCA in the Datacenter** [0]. If you use this code in your research, we
ask that you reference the Jumanji paper [0] in any resulting publications, and
that you send us a citation of your work.
